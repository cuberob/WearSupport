WearSupport - Supporting elderly using Android Wear Smart Watches

An expandable watchface aimed to support older users, 
during development a paper by J. Morgan Morris on interface design for older adults was used to guide it's design.

The application itself is expandable by means of "WearSupport Extensions", providing an extension launcher when the watchface is clicked.

Core functionality:
1.	Display the current time (analog or digital).
2.	Tracking the user’s activity in the form of steps taken, the application does this by using the sensors in the smartwatch.
3.	Helps the user to check whether he completed his daily activity goal, defaulting at 3000 steps a day, and optionally displaying the exact amount of steps for interested users.
4.	Allow a caretaker or family member to remotely check up on the user’s activity by sending a text message to the smartphone associated with the smartwatch running WearSupport*.
5.	When enabled, automatically send warning messages to an emergency contact in case no activity is detected throughout a day*.
6.	A menu to launch extensions** designed to work with WearSupport.
